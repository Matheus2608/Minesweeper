# Minesweeper
This repository is my solution to [Minesweeper project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/minesweeper/) of [Introduction to Articial Intelligence with Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home) course by Harvard.

## ðŸš€ How to execute:
- Clone the repository using ```git clone``` 
- Install the dependencies listed on [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt)
- Run ```python runner.py``` on your terminal to play against my AI!

Observation: The AI wont ever win, but im the majority she will.

## ðŸ”Ž Understanding:
There are two main files in this project: runner.py and minesweeper.py.
- [minesweeper.py](/minesweeper.py) contains all of the logic for playing the game, and for making optimal moves. 
- [runner.py](/runner.py) contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game.
The functions are very well explained in the code.
